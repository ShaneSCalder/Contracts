Initial test script - please verify that it is uptodate before using, is not a total solution but of set of tests 
1. "Contract deployment" item: The test checks that the smart contract deploys correctly and has a valid address.
2. "Constructor initialization" item: The test checks that the smart contract constructor initializes the state variables correctly using the constructor arguments.
3. "Default values" item: The test checks that the smart contract correctly sets default values for the state variables.
4. "Constructor arguments" item: The test checks that the smart contract handles constructor arguments correctly and uses them to initialize the state variables.
5. "External dependencies" item: The test checks that the smart contract initializes external dependencies correctly and configures them during contract initialization.
6. "Event emission" item: The test checks that the smart contract emits the expected event with the expected data upon successful initialization.
7."Contract upgrade" item: The test checks that the smart contract upgrade mechanism works correctly and initializes the new contract instance with the expected values.
By testing these aspects of the above items.
